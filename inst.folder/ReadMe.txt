User Manual for "Tuple Out" Dice Game
- "Tuple Out" is a two-player dice game where the goal is to be the first to achieve or exceed a target score of 50 points. Players throw three dice and score points until they "tuple out" (roll three matching numbers).

How to Play:
- Run the program in question. The game starts with Player 1's turn.
- First to 50 points wins

Player's Turn:
On your turn, the three dice are automatically rolled. The outcomes are displayed. If all three dice are the same (for example, [4, 4, 4]), you "tuple out," and your score for the turn is zero. Otherwise, the dice might be fixed if a pair occurs. 

Re-roll or stop:
- You can re-roll the unfixed dice or end your round to keep your current score.
- When asked to reroll, type y. A new roll is performed for unfixed dice, and your revised dice are presented.
- To end your round, type n, and the sum of all dice is used to calculate your score.

Win condition:
- After each turn, your overall score is updated. If your overall score equals or exceeds the target score 50, you win! The program declares the winner and displays both players' final scores.

Your only inputs
- Re-roll Prompt: Type y to re-roll unfixed dice, or n to stop and maintain your current score. Any other input will prompt you to enter a valid response.

Good Luck!
